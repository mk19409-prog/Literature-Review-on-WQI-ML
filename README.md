📌 Project Overview: This repository contains our Literature Review on Water Quality Index (WQI) prediction and classification using Machine Learning techniques.

The objective of this review is to:
- Analyze recent high-quality research articles (2022–2026)
- Evaluate ML/DL approaches used for WQI prediction
- Identify limitations and research gaps
- Highlight the need for a scalable and adaptive AI-driven WQI framework
The document is prepared using the IEEE LaTeX template and synchronized between Overleaf and GitHub.
